This place is reachable by navigating the [[Ember Twin - Crash Site Caves]], whose entrances are on the surface areas of [[Escape Pod 02]] and on a cave entrance  on the lower stairs of [[Communication Tower]].

Another reachable option is the use of the secret entrance at the surface around [[Gravity Cannon - Ember Twin]], through the mountains there is a hole with Ghost Matter, if you navigate correctly, you can get straight into the Sunless City, while having a ship nearby for quick refueling.

Historical records, mention that the Nomai race had a debate about building the [[Sun Station]] so that they could generate power for the [[Ash Twin Project]], I guess they wanted to discover if they could make the sun go through its life cycle phases faster, so that they could collect solar power through solar panels to give enough power output to make the [[Ash Twin Project]] possible.

There is a series of switches that allow you to turn the power source on on sections of the Sunless City, this allows you to explore the Sunless City more efficiently, but might block you from going down on some force gravity elevators that will be turned on.

There are records saying that the [[Anglerfish Fossil Site]] can be accessed through the [[Stepping Stone Cave - Ember Twin|Stepping Stone Cave]], this would allow us to read the Nomai records over there.

There are records that reflect on the purpose of the [[Eye of the Universe]], if there is any meaningful fate for them to find it, or if it was just a random sequence of events on the universe that happened to fall over their civilization. The reflections also talk about the age of the universe, the fact that the eye of the universe is older than the universe and musings about how it existed before the universe and if it had a creator.

Sand is always filling on this room and some places become inaccessible over time.

This place has connections to other places through the use of gates and doors.
- A gate connecting to [[Ember Twin - Crash Site Caves||Crash Site Cave]]
- Two gates connecting to the Stepping Stone Cave at different heights
- A gate connecting to the Gravity Cannon secret exit
