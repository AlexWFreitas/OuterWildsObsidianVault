Allows you to scan and locate frequency waves through the star system.

Captured signalscope frequencies are split into many types, each one is related to a certain type of signal and by scanning using the correct type and pointing to the source of the signal, you are able to measure the distance to the object, hear the signal to possibly identify the source by the sound.

It also allows you to locate the source of the signal if you move towards the signal.
