This cave is entered from the interior of the [[Escape Pod 02]]

It contains four paths
- One is blocked by rocks.
- Another path leads to a blocked cave with an [[anglerfish]] fossil inside, it seems they wanted to research it eventually
- Another path takes you to the [[Crash Site Caves Entrance - Air Refill.png]] 
- The other path leads to a possible shelter where the [[Nomai race]] used to live after landing on this planet.
