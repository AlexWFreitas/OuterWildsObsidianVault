This place is a astral body that changes over time.

At the start it seems like this place has nothing, but as time goes on, more and more of the sand that this planet is made of is transferred to the **Ember Twin** and this causes this planet's inner structure to be revealed.

Home to the [[Ash Twin Project]], though the core is inaccessible because it is inside the center of the planet surrounded by ores and stones.
