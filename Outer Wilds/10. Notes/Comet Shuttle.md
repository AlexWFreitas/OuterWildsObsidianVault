This [[Shuttle]] was sent to explore [[The Interloper]] and was launched from the [[Gravity Cannon - Ember Twin]].

It seems that after reaching the comet, the shuttle was frozen because the back of the comet has a very low temperature. Not only that, while exploring the comet, it seems that most of the survivors of the [[Nomai Race]] died due to the exposure to [[Ghost Matter]] and the [[Superdense Content inside the Comet.png|Superdense radioactive matter inside the Comet]].

Some of the travelers from the Shuttle went outside it to investigate the Comet innerwards.
