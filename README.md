# Outer Wilds Canvas - May Contain Spoilers about the Game

This is a vault for Obsidian that contains a Canvas Project that was made to understand and organize information from my first playthrough of the game Outer Wilds.

Since the game is very exploratory and non-linear and Obsidian Canvas released recently, I thought that I would pair my first playthrough of the game together with experimenting and practicing with the Obsidian Canvas features.
 
This project was a very interesting learning experience to me, because as I used canvas I started to develop certain models that I would apply to the rest of the created notes and canvas, improving the note taking process over time.

I am very happy with the final result and I don't plan to make many changes to this project.

This canvas project was nominated to the Gems of the Year of 2022 Contest of the Obsidian Community.
