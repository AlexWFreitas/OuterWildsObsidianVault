- Located at the [[Ember Twin]].
- Works as a [[Quantum Moon]] Locator showing the location of five known planets where the [[Quantum Moon ]] can orbit and the current location of the [[Quantum Moon]].
- The astral bodies where the Quantum Moon can orbit are:
	- [[Ember Twin]]
	- Timber Hearth
	- Brittle Hollow
	- [[Giant's Deep]]
	- [[Dark Bramble]]
	- A sixth unknown astral body that can't be tracked
- The sixth astral body is probably the [[Eye of the Universe]]
- The actual purpose of this is to allow you to understand that the Quantum Moon keeps warping, that it usually orbits 5-6 planets, of the existence of a sixth unknown body and that there are mechanics that trigger the quantum moon warp.
