Stays on [[Attlerock]] whistling on the [[Outer Wilds Ventures]] Frequency and observing others through the use of [[Signalscope]] and [[Little Scout]].

Apparently Attlerock was used as a repair bases, so he was probably stationed there to help with that.

He mentions that others often forget about him, if you take a look at the picture from the [[Outer Wilds Ventures]] founders, his signature was on the picture, this might mean that he is a member of the founders, but they forgot to write about him on the description.
