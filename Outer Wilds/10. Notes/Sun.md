The Sun is the star of the [[Outer Wilds - General Info|Outer Wilds]]' solar system.

It's located at the center of the solar system and is orbited by a [[Sun Station]] that was created by the  [[Nomai Race]], because of it's mass density, it possesses a very strong gravity pull.

The Sun explodes at the end of a [[Time Loop]], causing a [[Supernova]] that kills everything within the range of the explosion, causing the death of everyone and then activating the [[Ash Twin Project]] because it was able to generate enough energy through the Solar Panel Towers.

This allows the [[Orbital Probe Cannon Project|Orbital Probe Cannon]] to launch another probe at the start of the loop in search of the [[Eye of the Universe]].
