Available through the use of a [[Space Suit]] or a [[Space Ship]].

Allows you to launch a flying scout drone on a straight line, this allows you to take photos of distant places and explore unnacessible areas.

The scout can warp back to the user through the use of Nomai inspired technology.

The camera on the Little Scout can view [[Ghost Matter]], allowing you to avoid being harmed by areas that contain it.
