Located on [[Brittle Hollow]] surface above [[The Crossroads]]. 

This was probably the workshop that manufactured the [[Gravity Crystal]], used all over [[Brittle Hollow]] and maybe even on the [[Gravity Floor]].

There is an entrance on the roof of one of the houses that leads to the [[The Crossroads]].
