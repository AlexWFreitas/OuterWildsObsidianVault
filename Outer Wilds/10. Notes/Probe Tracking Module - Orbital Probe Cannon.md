The Probe Tracking Module of the [[Orbital Probe Cannon Project|Orbital Probe Cannon]] was missing when the Orbital Probe Cannon was destroyed.

I found it inside the Core of the [[Giant's Deep]] Planet by using a Jellyfish to get through the electrical barrier of the Core.

It seems that the [[Ash Twin Project]] together with the Orbital Probe Cannon has been able to find the [[Eye of the Universe]].
