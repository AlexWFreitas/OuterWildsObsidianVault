- Time travel was first discovered after someone used the [[White Hole Station]] to teleport to the [[]]
- The time warp technology refers to the use of a Black Hole Core and a White Hole Core to enable the teleporting of mass, with this teleport occurs a phenomenon that causes the traveler to go to the past by a certain amount of time.
- When entering the [[High Energy Lab]] there is a Test Chamber where you can place Warp Cores, if you place a Black Hole Core and a White Hole Core into the Test Chamber and throw something at it, the thrown object will teleport from the black core to the white core position and will cause a time distortion over the object
- There are notes about the tests they made, the results and they were able to increase the time distortion on the warped object by increasing the power used on the experiment, this caused the time difference to increase, but energy required to do this increases on an exponential rate.
- This phenomenon can be reproduced on the lab by rerouting the power from the Sunless City to the High Energy Lab, when you do that, the object arrives through the White Hole before it entered the Black Hole, showing the proof of time travel.
