There are many possible endings depending on your actions at turning points.

The ending is reachable by going to the [[Eye of the Universe - Hypothesis]], by using the [[Vessel]] warp technology together with the [[Advanced Warp Core]] from the [[Ash Twin Project]] and warping to the coordinates found on the [[Probe Tracking Module - Orbital Probe Cannon]].

Doing so means that you disable the [[Ash Twin Project]], which means that if you had died or failed, the universe or star system would explode because of the supernova and you wouldn't be able to go back to the past, at least on that speciifc timeline.

*Even if you fail, it seems that you are still able to go back to a past "life", since the game talks about the uncertainty of the Universe, maybe while that timeline might have ended, there are tons of other possibilities where you didn't remove the [[Advanced Warp Core]] or failed the process of going into the [[Eye of the Universe - Hypothesis]], this might mean that for each time that information is sent to the past there might be infinite possible branchs emerging from that timeline.*
