- Chert's has been on this campsite for a while.
- It seems that he is being affected by the time loop since he saw many Supernovas in the period of a day, but he doesn't perceive it as a time loop.
- He explains some of the mechanisms of the Hourglass Twins and how they transfer mass and that they eventually go into a reverse pattern.
- He also mentions that after some time the Ash Twin changes and shows hidden structures because of the transfer of mass between the twins.
