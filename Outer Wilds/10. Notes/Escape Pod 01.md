Located on the surface of Brittle Hollow

The escape pod is an emergency escape vehicle used by the crew of the [[Vessel]] in an attempt to survive when the vessel crashed into the Dark Bramble.

Near the Escape Pod, there is a Distress Signal Emitter that can be tracked through the use of [[Signalscope]], this Distress Signal Emitter is present on all three locations of the [[Escape Pods]] and once you discover the frequency, you are able to detect the other sources of this signal using the signalscope.

There is a pager with around 14 messages, talking about the other escape pods, and the context of the emergency escape.

There were messages that talked about the [[Hollow Lantern]] hazards and the general planetary characteristics on their attempt create a shelter in this planet.

There are stairs at the back of the escape pod that lead to the [[Abandoned Shelter]].
