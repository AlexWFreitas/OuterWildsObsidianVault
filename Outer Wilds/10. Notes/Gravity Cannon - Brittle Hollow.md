# Surface
There is a spiral cannon looking area in [[Brittle Hollow]] that contains an entrance to the underground where a space ship might be able to land.

This place is a Gravity Cannon, it's an artifact that is used to launch things into space through the use of reverse gravity, another use for it, is tracking and retrieval of a space ship named [[Shuttle]].

# Underground

On the underground there is a [[Gravity Cannon - Brittle Hollow]] device, this device has a number of functions.
- You can activate the gravity cannon to create a reverse gravitational force that pushs things away from the center of the cannon.
- You can track the position of a [[Shuttle]] that has been launched.
- You can send a command to the Shuttle to make it return to the Gravity Cannon, while boarding it may not be useful, you can explore the contents of the [[Shuttle]], knowing that it might provide clues to better understand the universe of the game.
