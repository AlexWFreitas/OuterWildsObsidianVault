There are theories that say that the universe was formed by unknown means, but that initially it was hot and very dense

Over time the universe expanded, and got colder, the universe particles joined together and created planets, stars and galaxies

This expansion is always accelerating, this means that things are getting further and further apart, this could mean that some places of the universe become unreachable in realistic terms after some time

This evergoing expansion eventually causes entropy, because the universe will get colder over time with the loss of energy, reaching a point where the universe will die because there will be no more heat or energy
