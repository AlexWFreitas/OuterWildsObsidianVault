Dark Bramble is a space sector that contains an invasive giants plant species that create Dark Brambles that expands over time, fuses into things and also destroy things.

On that sector, there was a planet made of ice crystals, then when a Dark Bramble Seed invaded the planet, it was destroyed from the inside, exploding the planet and sending parts of it all over the solar system, some of these pieces have landed on other planets from the solar system, and some of those parts brought Dark Bramble Seeds with them.

Dark Bramble is home to a nest of [[Anglerfish]] and they will hunt anyone who enters their territory, with proper technique it's possible to avoid most anglerfishes by sneaking around without making sound.

Dark Bramble is unique in a way because the interior is bigger than the exterior, because of [[Dark Bramble - Space Distortion|Space Distortion]] effects, it seems that it's very hard to navigate and understand its inner areas.
