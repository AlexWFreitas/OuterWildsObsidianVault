This place can be seen from the [[Go up the stairs.png|Anglerfish Fossil Overlook]] near the [[Sunless City]] entrance coming from the [[Ember Twin - Crash Site Caves]] without being accessible.

Sunless City records say that there is a secret path to this area, you need to throw a Little Scout through the Anglerfish mouth, then when using the light and camera, you discover that there is a fissure above the Stepping Stone Cave that allows you to get inside the site.

Through this site, you discover that Anglerfishes are actually blind, it's worth exploring this.

On Nomai records, they mentioned that this fish is not from the Ember Twin, but might have come from the Dark Brambles somehow.

There is an door that you can unlock through this area that connects you to the [[Escape Pod 02]]
