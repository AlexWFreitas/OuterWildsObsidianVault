The Ash Twin Project has been a mystery for most of this story.

I found the true purpose of them inside the [[Statue Workshop]] of [[Giant's Deep]], the [[Ember Twin]] structures, the [[Sun Station]] and other planets by collecting clues about this big project that the Nomai race designed.

The Ash Twin Project is a project that tries to send memories to the past, using a memory collecting device through the use of [[Nomai Statue|Nomai Statues]] to collect memories from paired beings, these memories are then sent to the [[Ash Twin Project]], where they are stored and then sent to the past through the use of [[Time Travel]] mechanics, where they then arrive at the minds of the paired beings that are inside some type of time loop caused by time travelling.

When investigating the [[Ember Twin]], there were notes about constructing [[Warp Tower]]s on [[Ash Twin]], each tower would have icons that match the characteristics of the destination planet.

If we consider that the [[Time Loop]] started happening after pairing with a Nomai Statue, then we might consider that the combination of the time loop and memory transfer is an intentional design by the ones who created those statues.

It seems that the memories that are transferred to the Ash Twin Project are then sent to the past, reaching the person that was living at that time, this could cause the timeline to change and creating a completely new timeline, the problem with that is that this will enter an infinite loop, unless there is a way to break the cycle, probably by accomplishing the objective of either trying to stop the [[The Interloper]] from crashing into the star or by finding the Eye of the Universe and sending data about it to the Nomai Statues.

One important point is that if the Ash Twin Project fails, it will trigger the time loop mechanism by sending memories to the past, so the time loop that happens in the game is probably due to the project failing to reach its objective.
