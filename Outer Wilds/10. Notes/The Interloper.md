*I suspect that this is the Weird Moon mentioned in Nomai writings that appears sometimes near planets, its orbit is different from the other astral bodies on this star system*.

*This is definitely different from the [[Quantum Moon]] though, since it doesn't have the [[Quantum Observation]] behavior.*

The Inteloper is actually a Comet.

The back of the Comet is very cold and contains a frozen [[Comet Shuttle]] similar to the one that supposedly went to the [[Quantum Moon]].

After witnessing the [[Supernova]] event while paying attention to The Interloper, I can confirm that the Interloper crashes into the Sun around 1-3 minutes before the supernova occurs.

**Trivia: This reminds me of the Nibiru Conspiracy Theory about a planet that has dangerous orbit that could destroy Earth and only approaches Earth every x thousand years.**

**Trivia: If the inspiration for this entity is similar to the Nibiru Conspiracy Theory, then it is safe to say that The Interloper will crash into the star, causing the Supernova.**
