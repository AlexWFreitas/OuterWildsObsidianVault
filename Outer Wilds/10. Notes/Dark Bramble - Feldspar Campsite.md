After [[Feldspar]] went to the [[Giant's Deep]] Core, he wanted to conquer [[Dark Bramble]], so he tried to explore it.

But he was quickly attacked by [[Anglerfish]]es and also had trouble exploring Dark Bramble because of [[Dark Bramble - Space Distortion]] mechanisms.

Eventually, his ship malfunctioned and was about to be destroyed, so he decided to abandon it, after doing that he started camping near a Anglerfish Fossil.

Because of these events, Feldspar has been missing for a long time and no one knew where he was.

Feldspar can give you tips related to going into the Giant's Deep [[Inner Core]] and also talk about a number of subjects.

# How to get there

The main way to get there is to visit the [[Dark Bramble Seed]] on [[Timber Hearth]] and send a scouting probe through the seed entrance. This will reach create a duplicate signal with one being near the seed you just launched the probe and also one near the [[Dark Bramble]] Sector.

If you point the [[Signalscope]] on the [[Outer Wilds Ventures Frequency]] into the dark bramble seed or go to the dark bramble sector, you can notice that there is a music signal that uses the musical instrument of Feldspar.

Since you can't enter the unsprouted [[Dark Bramble Seed]], you need to go the dark bramble sector, when reaching there, you want to use either the probe or the signal scope as a guide to reach the Feldspar Campsite.
