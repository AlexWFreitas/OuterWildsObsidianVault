There is a drawing on [[Quantum Moon]] that talks about three things that the person who wants to go to the [[Eye of the Universe]] version of the Quantum Moon needs to know.

The first is already applied because it's needed to reach the Quantum Moon, the principle of [[Quantum Observation]].

The second one is about [[Quantum Travel through Entanglement]], this is applied through the use of complete darkness to cease the observation of a quantum object while being entangled to it, to make the Quantum Moon orbit other planets.

The third and final one is on the [[Tower of Quantum Knowledge]], where it talks about the need of the Shrine being at the North Pole of the [[Quantum Moon]] to be able to reach the Quantum Moon [[Eye of the Universe]] State and be able to exit the Shrine.
