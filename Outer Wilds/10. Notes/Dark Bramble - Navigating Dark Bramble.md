To navigate around Dark Bramble, you need to deal with both the [[Anglerfish]] and the [[Dark Bramble - Space Distortion|Space Distortion]]. 

So among the navigation strategies, we should mention

The Signalscope can be used to find signal sources, allowing you to reach them

You can throw Little Scout probes inside a [[Dark Bramble Seed]] to track something that is on other side, while the signal may duplicate due to space distortion, each signal is true to the probe location.

There are some places outside of the [[Dark Bramble]] that contain a [[Dark Bramble Seed]],  you are able to throw probes into them, they will then teleport to somewhere and then you can use your space ship by going to the Dark Bramble to find them, two important locations are found through this method.

To avoid an anglerfish, you can scout ahead through the use of Little Scout probe to check if the light source is an Anglerfish or a Dark Bramble Sprouted Seed. 

If you are using the probe to find something and using Little Scout is not possible, then you can try to stay a minimum distance of each light source so that possible anglerfishes don't perceive you.

Anglerfishes are blind, this means that it's possible go past one without being attacked if you don't make any sound near it, considering that we are in space, it's possible to accelerate to generate forward momentum and then when danger arrives, you stop using the ship engine, letting the momentum carry you through it.

Probably for reasons of game design, if you go into back into the exit of a Dark Bramble sprouted seed that you entered last, you will get thrown outside of the Dark Bramble Sector, this allows you to go outside instead of getting lost forever.
