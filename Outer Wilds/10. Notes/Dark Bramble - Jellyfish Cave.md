This place is located on the interior of an exposed dark bramble bramble entrance near the [[Dark Bramble - Feldspar Campsite]] and Feldspar [[Space Ship]].

If you enter in it using your space suit, you can navigate through it until you warp to somewhere else that contains lots of ice crystals. 

This place contains recordings from [[Feldspar]] and a dead jellyfish beast, with the recordings, he talks about the usefulness of the jellyfish because their surface is immune to electric shocks.

This is useful when reaching for the [[Giant's Deep]] core because the core is surrounded by a strong electric barrier.

The Jellyfish Cave is actually located outside the [[Dark Bramble]] interior, you can see this if you fall outside of the cave, you will eventually notice that you are outside of the Dark Bramble interior, but near the entrance of Dark Bramble.

This means that you can go straight to the [[Dark Bramble - Feldspar Campsite]] by entering from the Jellyfish Cave and this works as a shortcut.
