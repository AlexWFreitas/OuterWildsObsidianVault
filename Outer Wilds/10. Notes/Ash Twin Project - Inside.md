After following the steps shown on [[Ash Twin Project - How to Enter]], you are teleported inside the Ash Twin Project area.

Inside this place, you find all the Masks that are paired to each Nomai Statue and you are able to know how much time has passed since receiving the last memory data and also how much time is left before they send the next batch of memory (because of a loop cycle).

When watching from the Projection Stone, you could see that there are 7 to 8 masks and three of them are active, when inside, you can read the texts that give information saying that the three paired statues are located on the Probe Tracking Module, the Giant's Deep and on Timber Hearth.

The paired objects are probably:
- Orbital Tracking Probe
- The main character
- The guy on Giant's Deep that knows about the time loop

Inside the ATP there is information about the main purpose of the project, such as sending information to the past and that this involved creating things like:
- Selecting a proper planet to execute the project, landscaping the planet through any means necessary
- Generating enough energy through solar generators.
- Trying to explode the sun through the use of the Sun Station to cause a supernova to generate enough energy for the Ash Twin Project to execute once.
- Sculpting statues that allow them to collect memories from paired beings
- Creating an Advanced Warp Core that would allow them to send information to the past
- Building an Orbital Probe Cannon that could be used to shoot a probe on a random direction, despite the cannon breaking after only one shot, the time loop would ensure that this one time would be enough for million of attempts.

It seems that the planned loop cycle is the following. 
When the Sun Station fires at the Sun, destroying it, it will use the power of the sun to activate the Ash Twin Project

This sends a message 22 minutes to the past ordering the Orbital Probe Cannon to shoot once, because the message was sent to the past by 22 minutes. 

The result is that after 22 minutes the act of destroying the Sun will happen again, creating a perfect 22 minute cycle loop.

The problem is that the Sun Station did not work in destroying the sun, so they tried to think about alternate ways of causing a supernova or ways of extending their lifespan.

*When reading this, I got reminded of [[The Interloper]], because when it goes near the Sun on every orbit cycle, it causes the sun to become more unstable, eventually crashing into the sun and causing a time loop, since the time loop is activated when the supernova happens, this means that the trigger for the time loop is actually the Interloper, and they succeeded in activating the Ash Twin Project in a tragic way.*

Expectedly, the next message talks about their exploration of [[The Interloper]], talking about potential prospects on their research and objectives. 

Since there are no more messages, it's certain that most of the Nomai race died while researching the Interloper.

Inside the Ash Twin Project, you are able to use a mechanism to remover the Advanced Warp Core, this would cause the Ash Twin Project to stop and cease to exist.

It's possible that we need to remove this core and take it to the [[Vessel]] to activate the final warp to reach the [[Eye of the Universe - Hypothesis]], through the use of the coordinates obtained by the [[Orbital Probe Cannon Project|Orbital Probe Cannon]].
