There are some rocks that move on their own when placed on a flat surface inside the Outer Wilds game.

This happens because those balls are being attracted by the gravity of the moon, as the moon orbits around [[Timber Hearth]], it exerts a gravitational force over everything around it, making the balls move when not under any other type of influence.

This is probably not possible in real life because of other elements of physics, but this can be noticed when we approach the fact that the Moon  affects the Tidal Waves because of their gravity influencing Earth.

This game applies the gravity concept over many areas, for example on the orbit of planets and satellites, the gravity strength of each planet being based on their mass, the gravity affecting how far you can jump, how fast you fall down, how much your space ship or yourself is attracted to the planet when you enter its range of gravity effect.
