The Probe Tracking Module of the [[Orbital Probe Cannon Project|Orbital Probe Cannon]] was destroyed and is now lost.

Found recently inside the Core of the [[Giant's Deep]] Planet by using a Jellyfish to get through it.

It seems that the [[Ash Twin Project]] together with the Orbital Probe Cannon has been able to find the [[Eye of the Universe]].
