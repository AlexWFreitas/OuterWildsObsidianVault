Things of note

Dark Brambles is a place that keeps expanding in size whenever you enter one of its bright circles or maybe whenever you send a Little Scout through one of its seeds.

Space works differently inside the Dark Brambles, it's possible for one scout to give multiple signals or stay at multiple places at once, because this area distorts how the space works.

Feldspar is actually camping there, it seems that he went to the Dark Brambles after getting to the core of Giant's Deep, then got attacked by Giant Anglerfishs, crashed into a huge vine and got his space ship destroyed

Afterwards he started camping on one of the areas of Dark Brambles that had the fossils of an Anglerfish

Anglerfishes are wary of other Anglerfishes because they are territorial, so the Anglerfishes Fossils work as repelents to other Anglerfishes

When sending a Little Scout through one of the Dark Brambles Seeds, it seems that the space inside of the Dark Brambles expands, so it's possible that you might be lost forever.

Because of how Dark Brambles works, it's possible that the reason the Vessel crashed is because of how Dark Brambles messes up the space coordinates.

This surely has potential of causing confusion when thinking about the location of the Eye of the Universe, since it could get distorted by the Dark Brambles effect.
