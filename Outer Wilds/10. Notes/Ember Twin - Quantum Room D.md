There is another quantum room that you can go by chance if you go under the area where Chert's campsite is, there will be a huge cave going downwards. If you keep following the path over there, you will eventually find a room blocked by cave stones or cacti.

The thing is, those blockers are quantum entangled, this means that if you stop observing them for a while and them look at where they were, they will have moved, which allows you to proceed until you find the quantum room D.

Inside this place there will be notes with observations about disappearances and how the quantum shards behave and there will be a quantum shard there too.
