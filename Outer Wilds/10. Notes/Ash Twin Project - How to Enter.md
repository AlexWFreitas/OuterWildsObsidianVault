Supposedly the [[Ash Twin Project]] is located inside the center of the Ash Twin planet.

The center of this planet is surrounded by rocks and ores and sealed from every single side.

This means that the only way to arrive there is either through quantum warping or through something that can teleport past the blockade.

From the possible options, we know that there is no quantum shards on the Ash Twin Planet.

This leaves us with the option of using The [[Warp Tower - Ash Twin]], on this planet we have five warp towers.

1. Sun Station
2. Timber Hearth
3. Giant's Deep
4. Brittle Hollow
5. Hourglass Twins

If you go on the Hourglass Twins Tower, you might have noticed that there are two warp devices over there, one of them takes you to the Ember Twin planet and the other doesn't work because when the planets align, you are pulled into Ember Twin through the falling sand mechanism because the ceiling is broken.

But if you pay attention to that room, you will notice that there is a wall with a ceiling that you can hug when the Ember Twin planet aligns, if you stay in that wall and wait until the planets align to then jump into the Warp Device, you will be able to reach the [[Ash Twin Project]].
