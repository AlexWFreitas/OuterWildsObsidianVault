The Vessel can be found by going to the [[Escape Pod 03]], finding the trail of white light boxes and then launching a probe into the Dark Bramble Seed that contains a portal to the Vessel.

After doing this, you need to track the second probe signal (farthest one) to find a way to the Vessel.

When you enter a Red Light Dark Bramble Transition, this is the Anglerfish Nest, there are a lot of anglerfishes right at the entrance, to avoid them, you need to pass through the transition and then let the forward momentum carry you forward, this will let you get past at least three anglerfishes.

Keep in mind the location of the probe that reached the Vessel, there is at least one more anglerfish on your path to it, try to avoid it by going through a way that doesn't approach the anglerfish.

If you are able to reach the next portal that the tracker points to, you will notice that it doesn't emit light, if you enter it you will reach the Vessel.
