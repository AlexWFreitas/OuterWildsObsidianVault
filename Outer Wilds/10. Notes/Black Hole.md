- On the center of [[Brittle Hollow]], there is a Black Hole that teleports you to a far place in the Solar System. Because of the huge mass that the Black Hole has, it bends the light that passes near it through its gravitational power, distorting the perceived vision.
- The Black Hole is connected to the White Hole, if you fall into the [[Black Hole]] you will be expelled at the [[White Hole]] location.
