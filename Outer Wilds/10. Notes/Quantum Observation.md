Quantum Observation is a concept that allows you to manipulate [[Quantum Shard]]s and their quantum behavior by taking images or observing something that behaves differently when you observe it.

If you observe the image of something that behaves quantically, it forces that object that the image is from to be force into a single possibility.

This allows you to freeze quantum objects, so that you can manipulate it in your favor.

This is extremely important when going into the [[Quantum Moon]].
