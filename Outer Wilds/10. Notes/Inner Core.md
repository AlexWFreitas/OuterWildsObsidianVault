If you enter the tornado that is on a reverse clockwise rotation, then you will get pushed into the center of the planet.

Inside there there will be a Inner Core that you aren't able to enter because it is filled with Electric Jellyfish Beasts.

To enter the Electric Core, you need to go inside a Jellyfish Beast from below while using a Space Suit and wait for it to pass through the Electric Barrier.
