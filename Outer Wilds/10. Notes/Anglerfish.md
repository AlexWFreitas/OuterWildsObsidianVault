A giant space fish species that live inside [[Dark Bramble]], seems to be territorial.

Anglerfishes avoid other Anglerfishes, including Anglerfishes Fossils due to the territorial characteristic.

Research made on Anglerfish Fossils says that they are native to the Dark Bramble Sector, it also says that they are blind, the light they carry with them is used as a lure instead of helping them navigate.

This means that if you want to avoid being pursued by Anglerfishes, either stay away from them or don't make sounds.

Inside Dark Bramble there is an Anglerfish Nest that contains lots of anglerfishes at every entrance. While it's hard to pass by them, it's possible to sneak by being silent.
