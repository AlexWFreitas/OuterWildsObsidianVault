On one of the notes found on the Vessel of the Escall Clan inside Dark Bramble planet, it says that the universe is dying, the stars are unstable, some of them are exploding and the Nomai Clans are trying to gather together in a single galaxy to try to devise means of preventing the death of the universe.

A glimpse on the concept of the Death of the Universe can be found on this note [[Origin and Death of the Universe]].
