Starting planet.

When you "restart" you respawn here.

Home of the [[Outer Wilds Ventures]] and the people who work on it.

Maybe the planet's name containing "Hearth" is inspired by planet Earth.

Another similarity to Earth is that it has a Moon and the first space landing for Hearthians was on the moon.
