When you land on the [[Quantum Moon]], you start at the south pole, from your starting point you won't be able to reach the North Pole, meaning you have to warp through other states of the Quantum Moon to be able to reach the North Pole.

So from the path of the South Pole to the North Pole, you are able to make shrines appear through the use of quantum mechanics.

Since not every area is the same, by warping through shrines to other states and walking towards the North pole, you will eventually be able to reach the North Pole.

A good path is the Giant's Deep version of the Moon, get into a shrine near the huge cyclone and then warp to another state that allows you to reach the exact point of the North Pole.
