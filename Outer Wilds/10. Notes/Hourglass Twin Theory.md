If the Nomai Race had the power to send things like memories to the past, then it's possible that the Hourglass Twin is a time based contraption that when trigger will send the current cycle memories of paired memory collectors to the past, so that they are able to change the future.

This allows them the power of launching one probe on a random direction for millions of times and then and send data collected by those probes to the past, while also allowing them to investigate a higher number of places for more information during the time loop.

So the actual view of the Technological Structure being hidden by the falling sand that goes from the Ash Twin to the Ember Twin, might be a trigger to cause the time loop to happen.
