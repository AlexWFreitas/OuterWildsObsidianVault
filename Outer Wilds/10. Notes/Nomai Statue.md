Nomai Statues were created by the [[Nomai Race]] at a [[Statue Workshop]] in [[Giant's Deep]].

This workshop is the origin of the Nomai Statues.

These statues are not mere works of art, they have a hidden mechanism behind them.

It seems that they have a pairing feature that links them with a living being, this living being will then enter a time loop whenever they die, causing the statue to copy the memories they had on that time period.

These memories are then transferred to a place that stores memories called [[Ash Twin Project]], this allows the Nomai Race to record and register memories of those beings who are paired with the statues.
