On the Ember Twin planet, you can read about a curious event where two scientists were researching the Quantum Shard and when one of them looked away, the other one had disappeared.

This happened because if you are in contact with a quantum shard and there is no one observing it, you start behaving in a quantic manner, allowing you to do quantum entanglement and teleport together with the quantum shard.
