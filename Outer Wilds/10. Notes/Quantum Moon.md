- The Quantum Moon has the same behavior as the [[Quantum Shard]], this means that if you stop watching it, it will move to somewhere else.
- There are writings about the Quantum Moon being seen on [[Ember Twin]], [[Brittle Hollow]] and [[Timber Hearth]], also [[Giant's Deep]].
	- One interesting tidbit is that there are Quantum Shards on the four places mentioned above.
- The Quantum Moon was also seen in [[Dark Bramble]].
- There is a sixth planet where the Quantum Moon travels to sometimes, this is probably the [[Eye of the Universe]] since it can't be located
- There is a [[Gravity Cannon - Brittle Hollow]] that was used to reach the Quantum Moon through a [[Shuttle]].
- The Quantum Moon can be located through the Locator of Ember Twin - [[Quantum Moon Locator]].
- If you try to enter a Quantum Moon by going inside it with the space ship, the Quantum Moon becomes ethereal and you right through it.  It feels as if it was a mass of gas, but it's probably due to the quantum mechanics that this happens. As it stops being observed when you enter it, due to the foggy view.
