On the Giant's End island, there are platforms with the Cyclone Icon on the floor, those platforms become active whenever an Island is under the effect of a [[Giant's Deep Cyclones]].

A person can then go inside that platform so that they don't thrown away from the island because of the launching properties of the cyclone.
