- One of the [[Hourglass Twins]].
- Located near the star of this star system.
- Interacts heavily with its other twin, the [[Ash Twin]] with a transfer of mass, revealing the hidden structures on [[Ash Twin]].
- Chertt said that the sand flow from the [[Hourglass Twins]] eventually reverses, so even if starts going from the [[Ash Twin]] to the [[Ember Twin]], eventually it might go from the Ember Twin to the Ash Twin.
- The impression that [[Chertt]] gave about the sand reversing might be because of the [[Nomai Statue]] showing him his memories in a rewinding pattern.
