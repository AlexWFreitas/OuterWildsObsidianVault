Over the sea around [[Giant's Deep]] planet, there is a great number of cyclones, those cyclones are caused by the strong currents in the planet.

Those cyclones make exploration over the planet difficult and they also affect the islands around the planet, by launching them into the space, where they will then fall back to the planet.

The rotation of the cyclone indicates if the cyclone will send someone upwards or downwards, one of the cyclones in the planet actually sends objects that enter it downwards, bypassing the current that usually blocks access to the core of the planet.
