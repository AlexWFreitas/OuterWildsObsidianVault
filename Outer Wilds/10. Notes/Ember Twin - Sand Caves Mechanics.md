Because of how the [[Hourglass Twins]] work, you want to go to the [[Ash Twin]] as late in the [[Time Loop]] as possible so that more of the hidden structures is revealed, and you want to go to the [[Ember Twin]] as early as possible, because the sand from [[Ash Twin]] is being transferred constantly into Ember Twin and this fills the existing caves with sand, eventually making some places unacessible.
