- High Energy Lab is a laboratory where the Nomai researched and tested the [[Time Travel]] hypothesis.
- After the researchers replicated time travelling through the [[Time Travel]] experiments, the Southern Laboratory wanted to send something to the past by an amount of 22 minutes, that is the maximum amount of time on the time loop before the world ends because of the Supernova caused by the [[The Interloper|Comet]]. 
- To be able to send something to the past for an amount of time like 22 minutes, you need to generate tons of energy, because the bigger the time difference, the bigger the energy expenditure, and this increases in a exponential rate.
- To generate enough energy, they had to devise plans to be able to generate more energy, they thought about using the Ember Twin and the Ash Twin to place Teleporters to be able to retrieve resources quickly and also to be able to harness the star energy through solar panels.
- This place can be said to be one of the turning points that caused the culmination of the [[Ash Twin Project]], the creation of the [[Sun Station]] and the use of [[Nomai Statue]] to collect memories and then send them to the past, creating the possibility of altering the past, which is something that is perceived as a time loop to the paired beings.
- There are notes about something being built on the Black Hole Forge on Brittle Hollow so that they can proceed with the [[Ash Twin Project]].
