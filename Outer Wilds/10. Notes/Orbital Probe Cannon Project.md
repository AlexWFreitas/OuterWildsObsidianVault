The Orbital Probe Cannon is a project that was created because the Nomai Race was frustrated about the difficulty in finding the **Eye of the Universe** through signal scanning

So they had the idea of creating an Orbital Probe Cannon so that they could search for the Eye of the Universe through visual means

The chosen location to deploy the Orbital Probe Cannon is the Giant's Deep astral body
