# Advanced Warp Core

There is a warp core that is more advanced than the normal ones, they are called [[Advanced Warp Core]] and they are used on places like the [[Vessel]].

There should be an [[Advanced Warp Core]] on the crashed [[Vessel]] inside [[Dark Bramble]].

The [[Ash Twin Project]] requires us to create or retrieve a working [[Advanced Warp Core]] so that the project can generate enough power to [[Time Travel]] 22 minutes.

# Spoilers

The [[Nomai Race]] was able to successfully create an [[Advanced Warp Core]], and install it on the [[Time Loop]] wouldn't happen.
Another point is that when you reach the [[Vessel]], it's Advanced Warp Core is broken, this means that you need to remove the one from the [[Ash Twin Project]], because you don't have the know how to create a new one from scratch.
This leads to the endgame where you use the [[Vessel]] together with the [[Advanced Warp Core]], to do warp using the coordinates of the [[Eye of the Universe]].
