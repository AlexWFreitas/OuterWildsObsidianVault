Necessary resource to survive in a any planet.

When using a [[Space Suit]], it provides a supply of  oxygen provided by it allows you to breathe while in underwater, space or other planets.

Oxygen can be recharged by going near plants that produce Oxygen. *Weird!*

Oxygen is also used when using the [[Jetpack]] from the [[Space Suit]] after the fuel is emptied.
