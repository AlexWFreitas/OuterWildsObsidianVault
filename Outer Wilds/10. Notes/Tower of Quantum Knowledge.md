- Seems to be properly accessible when you finish preparations on Giant's Deep
- Reaching this place talks about going to the Quantum Moon
- Says something about letting the Quantum Moon take us there
- There is some type of sixth and most secret location on the Quantum Moon, it can only be accessed when the Shrine is on the North Pole
- Also there is something about the Nomai building a Shrine to help us get there
