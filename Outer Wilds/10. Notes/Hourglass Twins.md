The Hourglass Twins is a sector of the star system that contains two planets that are connected to each other through falling sands.

The planets are [[Ember Twin]] and [[Ash Twin]].

They seem to mimic the inner working of a Hourglass because not only the sand is transferred from one planet to the other, but eventually after the sand is completely transferred, the direction the sand falls reverses transferring the sand back to where it came from. 

Creating a cycle that looks similar to a sand hourglass, causing the nickname of Hourglass Twins.
