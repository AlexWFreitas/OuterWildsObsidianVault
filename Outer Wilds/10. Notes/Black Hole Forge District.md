- Seems to be upside down, meaning that it depends on [[Gravity Floor]] to work.
- The path to it through the [[Hanging City]] gravity floor tower is blocked because it has collapsed on the way from the third floor to the fourth floor.
- There is a [[Warp Receiver]] at the [[Black Hole Forge District]], this means that there is another [[Warp Tower]] that will bring you to this [[Warp Receiver]].
- More information about this area can be found on the [[Black Hole Forge]] page, because the way to this place can't be reached from this position unless you brute force with your space ship.
