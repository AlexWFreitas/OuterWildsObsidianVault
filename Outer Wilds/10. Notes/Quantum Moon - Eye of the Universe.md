This place can only be reached through the use of the Quantum Moon Shrine when it's located on the North Pole.

Inside it you will find that the moon's appearance is very similar to the Quantum Shards that you find all over the star system.

After walking for some time, you find a current of air that is going outwards of the moon.

At the same place as the current of air, there is a living being called [[Solanum]], from the Nomai's Race, when you ask who is he, he offers to give answers through the use of stone combinations.

# Solanum Explanations

You can make any combination of stones, the order isn't important, only the unique combinations.

Blue Stones
- Me
- You
- Quantum Moon
- Eye of the Universe

Orange Stones:
- Identify
- Explain

Combination Descriptions:

## Identify You

Solanum explains that he is from the Nomai race and that the Nomai race has stayed on this star system since before his birth.

## Explain You

Solanum explains that he was on his first pilgrimage to the quantum moon as a coming of age practice. 

While the Quantum Moon of the Eye of the Universe is reachable, the Eye of the Universe itself isn't reachable through the Quantum Moon, still, this place is considered special since it allows them to be as close as possible to the Eye of the Universe.

Something about the Quantum Moon reflection allowing you to see the Eye of the Universe if you look at the sky.


## Identify Quantum Moon

Solanum says that the place we are currently in is the Quantum Moon.

He also says that the quantum moon is the moon of the Eye of the Universe.

## Explain Quantum Moon

Solanum talks that the Quantum Moon has the same properties and appearance as the Quantum Shards.

The Quantum Moon's primary location is orbiting the Eye of the Universe, this probably means that the Eye of the Universe is quantum as well.

It's possible that the Eye of the Universe is the main quantum entity and the Quantum Moon became quantum after becoming entangled with it by proximity.

The Quantum Shards that were sent to other planets, also caused the areas near it to become quantum as well.

## Identify Me

Solanum has never met one of my kind before, he admires the fact that we have four eyes.

He also appreciates the fact that we are able to understand his language, despite not understanding ours.

## Explain Me

He deduces that my purpose is to find the Eye of the Universe, just like his race objective.

He doesn't know how I got on the quantum moon, but deduces that my race might have come from another star system, just like his race did.

## Identify the Eye of the Universe

He says that we are orbiting the Eye of the Universe, we aren't able to see it, only the quantum moon's reflection of it. 

He says that the Eye of the Universe is older than the universe itself.

His clan believes that the eye of the universe orbits this star system, although on an extremely distant orbit.

## Explain Eye of the Universe

Solanum talks that there is a fundamental uncertainty throughout the universe, but it's only observable in a small scale. He mentions that the uncertainty grows as you get closer to the Eye of the universe.

Then he talks about the fact that the Quantum Moon displays macroscopic behaviors because of the proximity to the Eye of the universe, this pattern also happens with the pieces of quantum shards all over the star system.

Then he talks about a great question that the Nomai race asked themselves, if conscious observation of a quantum object forces it to choose a single possibility, what would happen if you placed a conscious observer inside the eye itself?

Would it stop the quantum uncertainty? Would it force the Eye of the Universe to remain fixed on single possibility, allowing it to be reached, tracked and viewed?

## Explain + Identify

The Nomai philosophy has two tenets. 

To seek out and to understand is their way of living.

## Me + You

He states that we don't have much connection.

But he still thinks of our encounter as something special and wants to think of us as friends.

## Me + Quantum Moon

He asks if this is my first time on the quantum moon.

He also states that if I came looking for answers, he hopes that I am able to find them.

## Me + Eye of the Universe

He asks if I would try to enter the Eye of the Universe if I was able to reach it.

He also asks what I think the effects would be if the Eye of the Universe had a conscious observer.

## You + Quantum Moon

Like many of his race, he pilgrimaged to the Quantum Moon to see the reflection of the Eye of the Universe.

He also states that he thinks that he might not be entirely alive, that he might have reached his journey's end.

## You + Eye of the Universe

He states that his clan thought that the Eye of the Universe had a purpose on their fates.

He once thought that the Eye of the Universe was malicious and lured the Nomai Race, only to disappear when they come near it.

Now he becomes fond of the Eye, hoping that one day he might be able to reach and see it directly.

He states again that he thinks that he might not be alive.

## Quantum Moon + Eye of the Universe

Solanum talks about the appearance of the Moon changing based on which planet it's currently orbiting.

He extrapolates the ability of changing that the Quantum Moon displays, also occurs on the Eye of the Universe. He also says that one of the characteristics of the Eye of the Universe is probably extreme changeability.

He mentions that the Quantum Moon is locked into a single state, whenever it's observed, so this could apply to the Eye of the Universe as well.

He ponders what would happen if there was a conscious observer on the Eye of the Universe.
