Planet surrounded by a thick fog, that makes hard to see it's inner parts without entering.

The planet's content is almost entirely made of water and giant jellyfishs.

On the surface of the planet there are giant cyclones that launch your ship into space, sometimes they launch the islands as well, this makes exploration very difficult.

Gravity strength is very strong, which hinders jumping and flying capabilities when using the space suit.

[[Gabbro]] is staying there

The [[Orbital Probe Cannon Project|Orbital Probe Cannon]] seems to have been built on this planet and now stays on the orbit of this plannet.
