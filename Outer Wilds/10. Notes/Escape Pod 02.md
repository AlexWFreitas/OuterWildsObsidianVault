This escape pod has crashed on Ember Twin's surface, it sent a Distress Signal.

It seems that no one died after the crash.

Ember Twin seems to be inhospitable because of the high temperatures, due to being near the solar system star.

It seems that they tried to survive on this planet by going inside the underground caves, because the temperature is lower and more bearable on those areas.

At the lower end of the Escape Pod there is an exit that goes inside one of the Underground Caves
