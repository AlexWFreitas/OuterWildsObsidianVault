Contains information about the Orbital Probe Cannon construction like blueprints and memos. One interesting tidbit is that they were using the cyclones to launch parts of the Orbital Probe Cannon into orbit, so they could be installed.

It seems that they tried to lower the maximum power output of the Orbital Probe Cannon so that they wouldn't be able to damage it by launching at full power.

This might mean that the cause of the damage on the [[Orbital Probe Cannon Project|Orbital Probe Cannon]] was something else, like sabotage or a strange physics phenomenom.

The other nomai writing says that the power source of the OPC had a defect and shouldn't be used to launch the probe.

Since the probe was launched, someone on the [[Ash Twin Project]] actually sent the command to launch the probe despite the warnings. Maybe it was activated because the Ash Twin Project activates when the project fails for some reason.
