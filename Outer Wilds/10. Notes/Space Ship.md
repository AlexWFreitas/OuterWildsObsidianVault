The space ship is initially located at the [[Timber Hearth - Launch Tower]], every space explorer from [[Outer Wilds Ventures]] currently on space has one.

The space ship is equipped with a [[Space Suit]], a ship log and allows you to navigate through space to reach other planets and locations in the universe.

Among the functions that the space ship has we can mention:
- Allows travel through space.
- Restore [[Health]], [[Oxygen]] and [[Fuel]].
- Launch [[Little Scout]] probes to take photos and track objects.
- Autopilot to travel towards a selected space object.
- Ship Log to collect and organize informations acquired during gameplay, while also providing a filter through a map of the star system.
- [[Solar System - General Info|Star system]] map of where the story happens, showing ordered planets by distance from the sun.
- Gravity Stabilizer through the use of a [[Gravity Crystal]].
- Headlight to help exploring dark places.

Things to pay attention:
- The ship may get damaged by a number of reasons.

- If the damage is big enough, the ship may explode or break into many parts.
- Autopilot is not perfect and may crash into planets and the sun.
