Communication Tower that probably receives memory data from the Nomai Statues or Probe Tracking Device.

Contains a projection stone pillar without a stone nearby, probably used to display its surroundings when viewing from other places that contain the Ember Twin projection stone.

Probably very important on the [[Ash Twin Project]]

It seems that those panels are actually Solar Panels.

The [[High Energy Lab]] is located below this area, but the entrance is closed.

There is a pathway to the Sunless City as well, but it is blocked by Ghost Matter.

There is an entrance to the Crash Site Caves here as well.
