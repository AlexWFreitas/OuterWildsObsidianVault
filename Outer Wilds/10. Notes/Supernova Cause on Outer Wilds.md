After on the core of the [[The Interloper]], I discovered that the Comet is carrying some type of super tightly packed matter that keeps getting more and more unstable, if this is released, this will destroy the entire universe.

*This leads to a reasoning that time loops were created to prevent this catastrophe from happening.* 

In reality the time loops happen because they wanted to find the [[Eye of the Universe]], but their project failed because they couldn't activate the [[Ash Twin Project]] because it required tons of energy, because their race became instinct when the Interloper released the [[Ghost Matter]] all over the solar system, causing everything to die instantly.

By using the [[Ash Twin Project]] together with the [[Nomai Statue]] pairing, it's possible to gather more info ~~and brainstorm ideas to prevent this comet from crashing into the star, releasing this most deadly matter into the universe, wiping it from existence.~~

Instead through the [[Time Loop]], it's possible to make more attempts at finding the [[Eye of the Universe]], through the use of [[Orbital Probe Cannon Project|Orbital Probe Cannon]].
