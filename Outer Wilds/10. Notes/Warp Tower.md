Warp Tower is a tower that is aligned with an external astral body, when the two planets align they will allow you to warp to the [[Warp Receiver]] on the planet that the warp tower is aligned with.

To know if a planet is aligned, just look at the ceiling of the warp tower, if the aligned planet near the center of the ceiling, then it means that the warp tower and the warp receiver are aligned.
