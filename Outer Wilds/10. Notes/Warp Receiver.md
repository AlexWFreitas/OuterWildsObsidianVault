A Warp Receiver is a place containing a White Hole Core that is used to receive a teleported object from an aligned [[Warp Tower]].

Whenever someone teleports to a [[Warp Receiver]] through the use of a Warp Tower, the Warp Receiver gets charged, allowing the user to go back to where he came from by stepping on the [[Warp Receiver]].
