The [[Orbital Probe Cannon Project|Orbital Probe Cannon]] was destroyed when the scientists behind the project ignored the power usage limits that Cassava from the Construction Yard warned about.

The most probable thing that happened was that they tried to go above the maximum limit and the Orbital Probe Cannon exploded, as it should.

The fact that the Orbital Probe Cannon had exploded wasn't really a problem for the [[Nomai Race]] scientists, because they knew that the Probe would only be launched if the [[Time Loop]] had been activated on the [[Ash Twin Project]]. Therefore, even if the Probe Cannon was destroyed, they would still be able to retrieve the info and use it again on the next loop.
