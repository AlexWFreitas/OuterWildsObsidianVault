# Surface
- Contains an entrance that leads to the [[Tower of Quantum Knowledge]] inner parts. 
- Contains a [[Quantum Shard]] on the surface, from where you can observe some of the quantum behavior that it displays.

# Underground
- The tower is unreachable because of a broken [[Gravity Floor]] path, I was able to access it when it fell into the [[Black Hole]] and entered the outer space with reduced gravity
- Seems to be properly accessible when you finish preparations on Giant's Deep
- Reaching this place talks about going to the Quantum Moon
- Says something about letting the Quantum Moon take us there
- There is some type of sixth and most secret location on the Quantum Moon, it can only be accessed when the Shrine is on the North Pole
- Also there is something about the Nomai building a Shrine to help us get there
