Another cave on Ember Twin that contains a teleporting Quantum Shard.

When one of the scientists was researching it, it seems that he disappeared going to somewhere else.

This happened because of a phenomenon called [[Quantum Travel through Entanglement]].

If you replicate the idea of standing in contact with a Quantum Shard and stop observing it, both the quantum shard and yourself will behave quantically because of the quantum entanglement, allowing you to teleport to the places that the quantum shard is able to teleport to.
