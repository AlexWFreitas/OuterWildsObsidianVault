- Emits signals on the Deep Space Frequency, is used as a Map for Navigation over the Solar System.
- Can be destroyed / damaged on a collision rendering the Map useless and possibly damaging other systems that depend on it
- The deep space satellite orbit is bigger than the orbit of other planets in the star system and is also on the opposite axis of the other planets. I wonder if the humans built something like this in real life, would it have a similar axis configuration?
