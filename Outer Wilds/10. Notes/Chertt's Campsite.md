- [[Chertt]]'s has been on this campsite for a while.
- He explains some of the mechanisms of the [[Hourglass Twins]], how they transfer mass and that they eventually go into a reverse pattern sending the transferred mass backwards to the Ash Twin.
- He also mentions that after some time the [[Ash Twin]] changes and shows hidden structures because of the transfer of mass between the twins.
