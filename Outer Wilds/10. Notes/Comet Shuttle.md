This shuttle was sent to explore [[The Interloper]] and was launched from the [[Gravity Cannon - Ember Twin]].

It seems that after reaching the comet, the shuttle was frozen because the back of the comet has a very low temperature.

Some of the travelers from the Shuttle went outside it to investigate the Comet innwards.
