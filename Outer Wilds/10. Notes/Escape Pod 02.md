This escape pod has crashed on [[Ember Twin]]'s surface, the crew members sent a [[Distress Signal]] that would allow others to find them.

[[Ember Twin]] seems to be inhospitable because of the high temperatures, due to being near the [[Solar System - General Info|Solar System]] star.

It seems that they tried to survive on this planet by going inside the underground caves, because the temperature is lower and more bearable on those areas.

At the lower end of the [[Escape Pod 02]] there is an exit that leads to the [[Ember Twin - Crash Site Caves]].
