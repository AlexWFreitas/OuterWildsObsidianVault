This place seems to be divided into two communication towers that also work as solar power generator one is on the north pole and one is on the south pole of this planet.

These towers are probably used to receive and send data, but also to generate power, if we go by the [[Ember Twin]] structure, we know that on Ember Twin they used one smaller tower to generate energy for the [[Sunless City]] and to power the experiments on the [[High Energy Lab]].

So this probably means that since those towers are bigger and in a higher number, the energy that they need to generate is even bigger than the one in Ember Twin.

Another point is that because these solar towers are besides the sun and the sun is going through the process of becoming a supernova, this means that eventually these towers will be generating the maximum throughput of energy. The planet's sand cycle will mean that whenever the supernova happens, the solar towers will have complete exposure to the sun rays, allowing them to generate energy optimally.

On the equatorial line of the planet there are a bunch of Towers connected by bridges that contain Teleporters similar to the one in **White Hole Station**, this is part of the [[Ash Twin Project]] as they needed those towers for quick transport to bring resources needed for the project as they needed.

These towers are known as [[Warp Tower - Ash Twin]]s and they can be used to get to all the main planets of this star system.
