An alien from the Nomai Race that used the [[Shuttle]] from the [[Brittle Hollow]] and was able to land on the [[Quantum Moon]] as a pilgrimage journey.

He is the only survivor of the [[Nomai Race]] at the present time that the game happens. Although I said survivor, he feels that he himself is not alive.
