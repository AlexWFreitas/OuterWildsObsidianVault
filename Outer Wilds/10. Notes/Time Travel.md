- Time travel was first discovered after someone used the [[White Hole Station]] to teleport to the [[Warp Receiver - Brittle Hollow - White Hole Station]]. When measuring the time of entry and the time of exit, it was found that the time of exit was earlier than the time of entry.
- Over time, time warp technology was developed, and it refers to the use of a Black Hole Core and a White Hole Core to enable the teleporting of objects, within this teleport occurs a phenomenon that causes the time travelling object to go to the past by a certain amount of time.
- When entering the [[High Energy Lab]] there is a Test Chamber where you can place Warp Cores, if you place a Black Hole Core and a White Hole Core into the Test Chamber and throw something at it, the thrown object will teleport from the black core to the white core position and will cause a time distortion over the object
- There are notes about the tests they made, the results and they were able to increase the time distortion on the warped object by increasing the power used on the experiment, this caused the time difference to increase, but energy required to do this increases on an exponential rate.
- This phenomenon can be reproduced on the lab by rerouting the power from the [[Sunless City]] to the [[High Energy Lab]], when you do that, the object arrives through the White Hole Core before it entered the Black Hole Core, showing the proof of time travel.
