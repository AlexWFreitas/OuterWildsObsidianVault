- South of Outer Wilds Ventures. 
- Place with tons of Quantum Shards that have erratic behavior if they are not being observed.
- Seems to be related to the Quantum Moon, somewhere no one has been able to land.
- [[Quantum Travel through Entanglement]] caused by the [[Quantum Shard]] causes nearby objects to display quantum behavior.
- There is a group of 4 wooden plaques with a phrase written in it, they change the order as quantum displacement happens, this was created by [[Gabbro]] as a form of art called **Quantum Poem**.
