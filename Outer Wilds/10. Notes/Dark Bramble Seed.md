Dark Bramble Seed is a seed that sprouts after some time, this seed will destroy its surroundings as an invasive species and will also generate other seeds.

Through the destruction of its surroundings, it's possible that they will launch other seeds all over the space, causing them to invade other planets and destroy them as well.

Each Dark Bramble Seed is connected to another seed through space distortion effects and possible quantum entanglement, this means that even if they are far apart from each other, they are still connected.

When a Dark Bramble Seed sprouts, it creates an entrance that connects to other sprouted seeds, this allows you to warp to other places.

Dark Bramble Seeds also seem to have space distortion effects, because the area inside each seed is bigger than the area outside them.
