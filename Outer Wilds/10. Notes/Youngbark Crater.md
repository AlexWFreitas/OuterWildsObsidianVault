- North of Outer Wilds Ventures.
- This crater started releasing smokes at the start of the game.
- [[Tektite]] was investigating it, I tried to launch the Little Scout inside the the glowing entrance and found an infinitely bigger area inside, than the area outside of the seed.
- That plant is actually a seed from the [[Dark Bramble]], it's an invasive species and causes the destruction of planets.
- If you use the Signalscope on the glowing entrance, you notice that there is someone playing an Harmonica, there is a missing outer wilder that uses a harmonica and plays on that frequency, the person that does that is [[Feldspar]].
- By launching the scout into the [[Dark Bramble Seed]], I was able to find the current location of [[Feldspar]], this can be used to find him by exploring the space with your space ship.
