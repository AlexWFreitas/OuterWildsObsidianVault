If you go to the Dark Brambles and consider the fact that the Anglerfishes are blind, you will be able to evade them by launching Little Scout Probes at every light you find and then checking if the light source is a Anglerfish or an entrance to somewhere else.

Together with this, you can use the Distress Signal Frequency on the Signalscope to scan the unknown signal that is inside this sector.

By doing this, you will be able to find the Escape Pod 03.

Inside the Escape Pod, they wrote about trying to find the Vessel, so that they could repair it.

They stated that there are two signals to the Vessel, when there should only be one, because of how Dark Brambles works, it's very possible one signal could be at two places at once.

They left a white light trail for me to use to reach one of the signals.

After following the trail, I found many corpses from the escape pod members that died while trying to reach for the Vessel.

It seems that the Vessel is on the other side of a Dark Bramble Seed, but you need to track it and get to it through other means.

To find the Vessel I thought about launching a probe into the seed and then follow it's second signal so that I can eventually reach it.
