- When teleporting through the [[White Hole Station]], it seems that the person who warped goes to the past by a measure of hundreths of a second. 
- This effect could be explained by [[Time Travel]].
- This phenomenom might explain one of the inner mechanisms of the [[Time Loop]] that happens every 22 minutes.
- Experiments and Research about this event will occur on the [[High Energy Lab]] near the equator of [[Ember Twin]].
