This cave can be accessed from two places on the surface, inside it there is a path that leads to the discovery of the Cave Shard.

This shard is a [[Quantum Shard]], but it seems that one of the researchers that was looking into it has went missing from the [[Lakebed Cave]], a place that is also one of the locations where the Cave Shard can appear.

Do note that you are able to do [[Quantum Travel through Entanglement]] on this room because of the lack of light, as long as you can make the shard not be observed by anything, then both you and the shard will have quantum behavior.
