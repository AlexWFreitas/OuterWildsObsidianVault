This is a cave that is connected with at least five different places:
1. [[Sunless City]]
	1. [[High Energy Lab]] Gate - Low height
	2. Stepping Stone Cave Gate - High height
	3. On the residential area, there is a corridor on the backside that leads to a door - Locked from the cave side
2. [[Anglerfish Fossil Site]] - Hidden area at the ceiling of the Stepping Stone Cave
	1. This leads to a connection with the surface near the [[Escape Pod 02]] that is locked by the cave side 
3. [[High Energy Lab]]

There isn't much to say, just that this place involves lots of jumping to travel around and is very dark.
