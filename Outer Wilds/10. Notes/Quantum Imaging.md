Quantum Imaging is the concept that allows you to manipulate [[Quantum Shard]]s and Quantum Mechanics by taking images of something that behaves differently when you observe it.

If you observe the image of something that behaves quantically, it forces that object that the image is from to be force into a single possibility.

This allows you to freeze quantum objects, so that you can manipulate it in your favor.

This is extremely important when going into the [[Quantum Moon]].
