*"Gravity Floor"* is probably a floor made of [[Gravity Stones]], it has the same capability of altering the gravity of the area around it, but it's a lot weaker, meaning you have to stay very close for it to work.

You can find them used in many places of [[Brittle Hollow]] and sometimes on other places, like [[White Hole Station]].
