There are some rocks that move on their own when placed on a flat surface inside the Outer Wilds game.

This happens because those balls are being attracted by the gravity of the moon, as the moon orbits around earth, it exerts a gravitational force over everything around it, making the balls move when not under any other type of influence.

This is probably not possible in real life because of other elements of physics, but this can be noticed when we approach the fact that the Moon and Sun affects the Tidal Waves because of their gravity influencing Earth.

This game applies the gravity concept over many areas, for example on the orbit of pl
