- Contains an entrance that leads to the [[Tower of Quantum Knowledge]] inner parts. 
- Contains a [[Quantum Shard]] on the surface, from where you can observe some of the quantum behavior that it displays.

# Tower of Quantum Knowledge - Underground
- The tower is unreachable because of a broken [[Gravity Floor]] path, I was able to access it when it fell into the [[Black Hole]] and entered the outer space with reduced gravity.
- Reaching this place talks about the correct way to reach the [[Quantum Moon]]'s secret location, that is orbiting the [[Eye of the Universe]].
- There are writing about letting the [[Quantum Moon]] take us to the sixth shrine.
- There is some type of sixth and most secret location on the Quantum Moon, it can only be accessed when the shrine built by the [[Nomai Race]] is at the north pole of the moon.
