The Escall Clan is a clan from the Nomai Race that was using the Vessel from where we found much of the Nomai's writing, artifacts and other things.

They used the Vessel to travel the universe, trying to find the Eye of the Universe, when they found a signal to it, they warped into it and crashed the Vessel into the Dark Bramble, destroying the Vessel.

In an attempt to survive they launched 3 Escape Pods on the solar system.

One of the escape pods crashed into the Dark Bramble and its crew died trying to find the Vessel, while leaving crucial clues on how to find the Vessel.

Another escape pod managed to reach Brittle Hollow, where they developed the Black Hole Forge, created technologies utilizing Black Holes and White Holes to execute teleportation in an attempt to recreate the Warp Core used on the Vessel and considering the idea of rebuilding the Vessel,

The other escape pod arrived on Ember Twin, where they were able to advance the technology related to Energy Generation, Time Warp and Memory Transfer and Storage by a lot. While developing a very advanced underground civilization to escape the heat.
