The main character is played by you, he has no name, but he is a member of the [[Outer Wilds Ventures]] space exploration team.

At the start of the game you are going to go into space for the first time, after going through the training.

At the start, you aren't wearing the space suit and you don't have access to the space ship, both of those things will be unlocked after getting the launch tower codes from the [[Timber Hearth - Observatory]].
