There is a drawing on [[Quantum Moon]] that talks about three things that the person who wants to go to the [[Eye of the Universe]] version of the Quantum Moon needs to know.

The first is already applied because it's needed to reach the Quantum Moon, [[Quantum Imaging]].

The second one is about [[Quantum Travel through Entanglement]].
