Interestingly the Frozen Jellyfish Island is surrounded by a Dark Bramble like structure, I wonder how this happened.

After exploring some more, I think I understand, there was a planet full of ice that was destroyed by the apparition of the Dark Brambles, when this planet was destroyed, it launched tons of ice shards to other planets on the solar system.

This caused frozen jellyfishes to appear on the Giant's Deep and they eventually became one of the beasts that inhabit that planet.
