There seems to be a time loop active because of the ancient race.

One of the conditions to start triggering the time loops is to look at the Nomai Statues,
these statues will pair only once and with the person who is closest to them it seems.

This time loop activates when you die, if you spend some time without dying, it seems that a space phenomena occurs that destroys everything in the universe causing the time loop to trigger.

If we consider the [[Nomai Statue]] of recording the memories a paired being had, then we might be able to consider that the time loop is something intentional caused by the ones who created the Nomai Statues.

The time loop triggers 22 minutes after the start of the current time loop.
