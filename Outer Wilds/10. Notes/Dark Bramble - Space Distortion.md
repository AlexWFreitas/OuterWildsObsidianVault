[[Dark Bramble]] Sector is a place that warps space, the interior of the Dark Bramble sector is bigger than when you look at it from the outside.

Dark Bramble seeds also contain a bigger space inside than outside, they also connect to distant but connected because of seeds places by unknown means of teleportation.

When tracking signals inside Dark Bramble, it seems that because of the space distortion effects, many signals will be duplicated, causing errors when trying to find the source, because of the signal being propagated by each seed that connects to the final location.

It's possible that the[[ Vessel]] crashed into Dark Bramble because the [[Eye of the Universe]] signal jumps between multiple places, but the Dark Bramble Sector also distorts the physical space perception.
