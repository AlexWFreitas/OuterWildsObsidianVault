On the equatorial line of the [[Ash Twin]] planet there are a number of towers that were built by the Nomai race when they were developing the [[Ash Twin Project]].

These towers were built to simulate the teleportation mechanism used on Brittle Hollow through the use of a black hole cores and a white hole cores.

As an interesting point there are two Warp Receivers on the Brittle Hollow planet, one receives a warp from the Ash Twin planet and the other from the White Hole Station.

The Nomai race wanted to have warp towers so that they could harvest resources from other planets and transport them quickly, allowing them to finish the Ash Twin project faster.

To use these Warp Towers you need to step on the floor that contains the black hole core while both planets are aligned when looking upwards.

This will teleport you to the destination while also allowing you to go back because the teleport will charge the warp receiver, allowing you to go back.

You can identify each tower by the symbols they decided on the [[High Energy Lab]].

Towers available:
- [[Sun Station]]
- Hourglass Twins
- Timber Hearth
- [[Giant's Deep]]
- Brittle Hollow
