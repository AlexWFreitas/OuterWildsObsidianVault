A star generates light and heat by fusing hydrogen into helium.

When it runs out of hydrogen, the star starts to contract, this causes the star to become a red giant, this makes the core hotter and expands the outer layers of the star.

When the core gets hot enough, it starts to fuse helium into carbon.

Once the star is massive enough, it will fuse carbon into heavier elements like iron.

Over time, the star will collapse under its own gravity, and then explode, causing an event called supernova.
