There is a place that looks like a spiral entrance that allows you to land your ship and get access to many places inside the Brittle Hollow like:
- **Southern Observatory**
- **The Crossroads**

There is a **Gravity Cannon** device that is able to retrieve a **Shuttle** that allows you to go to the **Quantum Moon**
- You can activate the Gravity Cannon to create a Gravitational Force that pushs you away from the Center of the Cannon
- You can command the Shuttle to return to the Gravity Cannon and then board it so that you can go to the Quantum Moon
