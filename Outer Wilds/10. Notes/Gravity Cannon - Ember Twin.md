This Gravity Cannon was used to launch a [[Shuttle]] on the back of the comet [[The Interloper]].

The Shuttle used on this cannon is different from the one used in [[Gravity Cannon - Brittle Hollow]].

With the gravity cannon controls, you can activate the gravity cannon to launch something into space through the use of gravity, or recall the Shuttle from that particular gravity cannon.

This cannon has an underground entrance to the [[Sunless City]].
