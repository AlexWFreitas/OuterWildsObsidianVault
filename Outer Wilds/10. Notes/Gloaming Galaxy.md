Gloaming Galaxy seems to be the name of the galaxy where the Outer Wilds story happens.

It's mentioned that the Nomai race noticed that the [[Dying Universe]] and tried to gather all the clans together, to devise plans on how to survive and prosper.

The other clans of the Nomai race were communicating with each other to select a place to gather, they managed to get most clans together, except for the [[Escall Clan]], that disappeared when trying to warp near the [[Eye of the Universe - Hypothesis]] signal.
