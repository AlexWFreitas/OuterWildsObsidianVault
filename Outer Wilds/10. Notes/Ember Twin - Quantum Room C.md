This planet has a room that has no exits or entrances, that some scientists have been able to enter.

They entered through the use of [[Quantum Travel through Entanglement]], by using one of the two rooms that have the random appearance of [[Quantum Shard]]s.

It's possible for you to get to this room by standing on one quantum shard from the Ember Twin and then stop its observation through the use of pure darkness.
