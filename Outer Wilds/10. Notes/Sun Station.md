The Sun Station is a orbiting station that is close to the sun of the Outer Wilds Star System

This Sun Station was created because the Nomai Race wanted to see if they could cause a Supernova, apparently for scientific purposes, so they created a Station that would launch something into the sun and accelerate the death of the Sun, causing a [[Supernova]].

The experiment apparently was not successful, but I think that it might have been successful, because the sun has been going through almost all of the life cycle phases in less than 30 minutes.

There are reports of other Nomai individuals finding something on the [[The Interloper]], this thing that they found is actually one of the [[Supernova Cause on Outer Wilds]]. Because the comet is carrying extremely dense and dangerous material and will crash into the sun, causing it to explode in a supernova.

The Sun Station has a Warp Receiver on one of the sides, but the bridge between both towers is broken.
