On one of the recordings from the [[Comet Shuttle]] crew, it said that some of the members went into the sunwards facing part of the comet and found an entrance that could be used to enter inside the comet, this is worth trying.

Whenever the comet is near the sun, the fissures on the front of the comet open, allowing you to explore inside.
