After on the core of the Comet, I discovered that the Comet is carrying some type of super tightly packed matter that keeps getting more and more unstable, if this is released, this will destroy the entire universe.

This leads to a reasoning that time loops were created to prevent this catastrophe from happening.

By using the Ash Twin Project together with the Nomai Statues pairing, it's possible to gather more info and brainstorm ideas to prevent this comet from crashing into the star, releasing this most deadly matter into the universe, wiping it from existence.
