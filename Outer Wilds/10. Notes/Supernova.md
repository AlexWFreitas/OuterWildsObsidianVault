An event that happens on this world after around twenty minutes inside a time loop.

This happens because of the Sun advancing rapidly through its life cycle over the course of the time loop, a comet named [[The Interloper]] also crashes into the Sun near that time, which seems to accelerate the Supernova event.

The Star at the center of the Star System collapses under its own weight and triggers a Supernova
