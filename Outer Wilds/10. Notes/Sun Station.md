The Sun Station is a orbiting station that is close to the Sun of the Outer Wilds solar system.

This Sun Station was created because the [[Nomai Race]] wanted to see if they could cause a [[Supernova]], on their search for the [[Eye of the Universe]], so they created a Station that would launch something into the Sun and accelerate the death of the Sun, causing a [[Supernova]].

The experiment seems to have failed, so the true cause of the Supernova is probably something else.

There are reports of other Nomai individuals finding something on the [[The Interloper]], this thing that they found is actually one of the [[Supernova Cause on Outer Wilds||Supernova causes]]. Because the comet is carrying extremely dense and dangerous material and will crash into the Sun, causing it to explode in a Supernova.

The Sun Station has a [[Warp Receiver]] on one of the sides, but the bridge between both towers is broken.
