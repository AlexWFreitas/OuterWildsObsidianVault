- A guy named Ilex that was with the [[Escall Clan]] members stranded in Brittle Hollow wanted to build a new [[Vessel]] so that they could travel again
- To do this he suggested that we stopped building things to find the [[Eye of the Universe]] and started using those resources to build a new [[Vessel]], he also suggested creating smaller Vessels at the start to find resources.
- It's possible that Ilex was one of the guys that died on [[The Interloper]] after reaching it through a "smaller" vessel named Shuttle.
