here is a scout probe launched on [[Timber Hearth]] that keeps orbiting the planet, this was probably used by the [[Outer Wilds Ventures]] to experiment with the concept of orbit and gravity, to use later on their objective of exploring the universe.

This scout probe can be damage by crashing into it, causing it either to go out of orbit and go missing or to crash into the planet.
