Missing for a long time.

The first astronaut from the [[Outer Wilds Ventures]] to go into space and land on another planet.

Plays a harmonica.

His instrument was heard on [[Timber Hearth]] through the [[Dark Bramble Seed]] that crashed into the [[Youngbark Crater]].

Currently inside the [[Dark Bramble]] because his ship was destroyed and there are dangerous [[Anglerfish]] everywhere.
