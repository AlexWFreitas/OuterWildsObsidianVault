- Emits signals on the [[Deep Space Radio Frequency]], provides a Map for navigation over the [[Solar System - General Info|Solar System]].
- Can be destroyed / damaged on a collision rendering the Map functionality useless and possibly damaging other systems that depend on it
- The deep space satellite orbit is bigger than the orbit of other planets in the star system and is also on the opposite axis of the other planets. I wonder if the humans built something like this in real life, would it have a similar axis configuration?
